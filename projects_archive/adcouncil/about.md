### R/GA Launches “Love Has No Labels”


Introducing “Love Has No Labels”– a three-minute online film created in partnership with the Ad Council to challenge people’s inherent biases.

Launched on Monday, March 2nd, the film has had over 50 million views in four days on Facebook and has just been released on YouTube.

The basis for the film was a stunt shot on Valentine’s Day 2015, in Santa Monica CA, which centered around a large simulated X-ray screen. On the screen, passersby witnessed full motion x-rays of people (skeletons) engaging in various acts or romantic and platonic love.

At first, it’s not exactly clear why you are seeing these skeletons. But once the people are revealed, it is clear that the pairing may not be what you would expect.  Whether it’s race, gender, disability, or age, the point is powerful:

Love Has No Labels.

The X-ray effect was created using the same motion tracking technology as the Seth McFarlane film “Ted” and motion capture for next gen video games. This made it possible for the skeletons to react live to the other people’s movement behind the LED screen.



The film is the center of a fully integrated effort that included television commercials, print ads, online ad banners, and social – all created by R/GA. All work pushes to a site designed and developed by R/GA, which features personal stories of bias and a quiz that challenges users to test their own implicit biases and understand how these may impact others.

Even major brands got in on the action. With major brands such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, P&G, Unilever, Allstate and State Farm, posting about Love Has No Labels and changing their profiles pictures to the LHNL mark. Even celebrities got in on the action, with social media posts from George Takei, Marlo Thomas, Deepak Chopra, and Mary Lambert, whose song, “Same Love” is featured in the video. All of this buzz encouraged the public and brand devotees to do the same.

Multiple R/GA offices worked together to create this campaign, including, creative, interactive, print and banner teams in NYC, film in LA, tech in NYC, Portland and Chicago and social teams in San Francisco and New York.

Take a moment today and watch the spot – we guarantee you’ll want to help spread this message:
